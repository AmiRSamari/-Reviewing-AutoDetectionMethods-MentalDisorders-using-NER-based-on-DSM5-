"Reviewing Different Methods of Automatic Detection of Mental Disorders and Their Symptoms in Unstructured text Using NER, based on DSM-5 document"

This project examines the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER), a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique, for the automatic extraction of symptoms of mental disorders from unstructured texts. NER identifies key entities such as symptoms and disorders and links them to categories related to mental health. For a thorough and reliable analysis, the DSM-5 document is used as the primary reference, providing global standard criteria for the diagnosis of mental disorders.

In this research, we analyze, review, and compare various NER methods to evaluate their effectiveness in identifying mental health-related information in text. The findings of this study contribute to the improvement of automated systems for the detection of mental health disorders.
